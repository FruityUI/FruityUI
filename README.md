# FruityUI

> _Under Development_

What is FruityUI? Ever wanted to customize your desktop with components? FruityUI can accomplish that. FruityUI is similar to [RainMeter](https://www.rainmeter.net/). Don't get rainmeter! FruityUI is or atleast should be better, and faster than RainMeter. 

As of now, Plugins can be developed and added to FruityUI, which will manually load each instance of FruityUI. FruityUI during development stages does not start on boot, which means to use this FruityUI has to be ranned first.
